        "However, given that we have years of data for each country, there is also the potential to use the change in the variable as a feature of our modeling. For example, rapid improvement in immunization coverage for a country would imply effective health education and could represent a more accurate picture of how the country is better educating the public about a new pandemic versus a country with a higher, but stagnant, immunization record. \n",
